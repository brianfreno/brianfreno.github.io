These methods solve kinetic equations that resemble equations such as the Vlasov or Boltzmann equations and are typically coupled with electromagnetic field equations.  These methods yield many code-verification challenges due to the various sources of numerical error and their possible interactions.  For the kinetic equations, error sources arise from the number of computational particles, the time discretization, and the interpolation of the computational particles onto the spatial grid.  For the field equations, error sources arise from the space and time discretizations.  Code verification has been performed on computational physics codes associated with several physics disciplines; however, existing literature contains few instances of code verification for computational plasma dynamics, especially with collisions.

The discretization of differential, integral, or integro-differential equations necessarily incurs some truncation error, and thus the approximate solutions produced from the discretized equations will incur an associated discretization error. If the solution to the problem is known, a measure of the discretization error may be evaluated directly from the approximate solution. The code may be verified by examining the rate at which the error decreases as the discretization is refined, thereby verifying the observed order of accuracy of the discretization scheme is the expected order of accuracy. Electromagnetic surface integral equations yield many code-verification challenges due to the various sources of numerical error and their possible interactions. These error sources arise from the use of basis functions to approximate the solution, quadrature to numerically integrate, and planar elements to represent curved surfaces.

As with the computational simulation of any physical phenomenon, the first step toward establishing credibility in ablation simulations involves code verification.

However, manufactured solutions generally require the invasive introduction of an artificial forcing term within the source code such that the code solves a modified problem for which the solution is known.

In this paper, we present two approaches to computing symmetric triangle rules for singular integrands by developing rules that can integrate arbitrary functions. The first approach is well suited for a moderate amount of points and retains much of the efficiency of polynomial quadrature rules. The second approach better addresses large amounts of points, though it is less efficient than the first approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches on singular integrands, which can often yield relative errors two orders of magnitude less than those from polynomial quadrature rules.","tags":["symmetric quadrature rules","quadrature rules for singularities","triangle quadrature rules","arbitrary functions"],"title":"Symmetric triangle quadrature rules for arbitrary functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579784400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579784400,"objectID":"889eb924e675bb2d79896cc378875b3b","permalink":"https://brianfreno.github.io/talk/machine-learning-error-models-for-approximate-solutions-to-parameterized-systems-of-nonlinear-equations/","publishdate":"2020-01-23T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/machine-learning-error-models-for-approximate-solutions-to-parameterized-systems-of-nonlinear-equations/","section":"event","summary":"This work proposes a machine-learning framework for constructing statistical models of errors incurred by approximate solutions to parameterized systems of nonlinear equations. These approximate solutions may arise from early termination of an iterative method, a lower-fidelity model, or a projection-based reduced-order model, for example. The proposed statistical model comprises the sum of a deterministic regression-function model and a stochastic noise model. The method constructs the regression-function model by applying regression techniques from machine learning (e.g., support vector regression, artificial neural networks) to map features (i.e., error indicators such as sampled elements of the residual) to a prediction of the approximate-solution error. The method constructs the noise model as a mean-zero Gaussian random variable whose variance is computed as the sample variance of the approximate-solution error on a test set; this variance can be interpreted as the epistemic uncertainty introduced by the approximate solution. This work considers a wide range of feature-engineering methods, data-set-construction techniques, and regression techniques that aim to ensure that (1) the features are cheaply computable, (2) the noise model exhibits low variance (i.e., low epistemic uncertainty introduced), and (3) the regression model generalizes to independent test data.

The reduced-order models use basis functions generated for on- and off-reference flow conditions. For on-reference flow conditions, proper orthogonal decomposition of the full-order model is performed to generate the basis functions. For off-reference flow conditions, basis functions are obtained through interpolating among basis functions corresponding to bracketing flow conditions. Interpolation is performed on a tangent space to a Grassmann manifold. This paper evaluates the accuracy of POD at off-reference flow conditions for subsonic and transonic flow regimes. The results show that interpolation yields good results for the subsonic cases, but the accuracy of the transonic cases is considerably lower. Furthermore, the energy spectrum is used to assess the necessary number of basis functions. It is demonstrated that in order to determine the number of basis functions, it is better to assess the variation of individual energy values, as opposed to the cumulative energy values.","tags":["proper orthogonal decomposition","reduced-order modeling","computational fluid dynamics","Grassmann manifold"],"title":"Using proper orthogonal decomposition to model off-reference flow conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brian A.

Using a beam model is especially beneficial in aeroelastic applications, which are computationally expensive.  This paper investigates the significance of each of the non-linear terms in a third-order non-linear beam model and shows the importance of retaining terms up to the third order. The approach presented in this paper provides an effective method to simplify the non-linear equations of motion by including the most significant non-linear terms. The resulting equations preserve the fidelity of the original equations and are easier to manipulate.","tags":["non-linear beam model","non-linear structural dynamics","structural non-linearities"],"title":"An investigation into the significance of the non-linear terms in the equations of motion for a cantilevered beam","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brian A.

Finite element analysis provides an effective and generalized method to model these structures; however, it is computationally expensive. Fortunately, the large aspect ratio of these structures is exploitable as these potential aeroelastically unstable structures can be modeled as cantilevered beams, drastically reducing computational time.  In this paper, the non-linear equations of motion are derived for an inextensional, non-uniform cantilevered beam with a straight elastic axis. Along the elastic axis, the cross-sectional center of mass can be offset in both dimensions, and the principal bending and centroidal axes can each be rotated uniquely. The Galerkin method is used, permitting arbitrary and abrupt variations along the length that require no knowledge of the spatial derivatives of the beam properties. Additionally, these equations consistently retain all third-order non-linearities that account for flexural–flexural–torsional coupling and extend the validity of the equations for large deformations.  Furthermore, linearly independent shape functions are substituted into these equations, providing an efficient method to determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the beam and to solve for time-varying deformation.  This method is validated using finite element analysis and is extended to swept wings. Finally, the importance of retaining cubic terms, in addition to quadratic terms, for non-linear analysis is demonstrated for several examples.","tags":["non-linear beam model","non-linear structural dynamics","aeroelasticity"],"title":"A computationally efficient non-linear beam model","type":"publication"}]
